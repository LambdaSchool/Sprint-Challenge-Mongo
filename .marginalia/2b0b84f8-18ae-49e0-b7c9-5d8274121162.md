## Step 2 - Endpoints

Add your code to `server.js`. Remember to install any npm packages you need.

### `POST to '/budgets'`

* Used to save a new budget to the database.
* Only worry about creating `ONE` budget for now.

* **NOTE** We only want to `create` a budget, no need to write a getter or even
  update the budget total directly. When we call for data to see how much is
  left in our budget, we'll write a separate endpoint that aggregates that
  information for us. We want to keep our budget total `'pure'` and unaffected
  by our queries.

### `POST to '/categories'`

* to `create` a category you should have a `'post'` method that stores the
  category information.
* you can write a `getter` `'get'` method that simply returns all the
  categories. Filter out any unuseful information here, meaning we just want
  the title of the categories.
* create a minimum of 4 categories so that when you create your expenses, you
  can assign where they go!
* example of categories could be: `Food/Dining` `Gas/Auto` `Date Nights`
  `Mortgage`

### `'/expenses'`

* your expense should have a `'post'` method for creating the expense. To save
  an expense you'll need an `'budget'` `_id` and a `'category'` `_id` so that we
  can build out a relationship between those other collections and our expenses.
* your expense route should also have a `'get'` method that returns all the
  expenses with the populated data.
