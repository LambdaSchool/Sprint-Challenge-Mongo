**Budget**

* This will be the budget that you set for Budget Tracker.
* An budget object saved to the DB should look like this:

```
{
  _id: ObjectId('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011'),
  title: 'Budget',
  budgetAmount: 3000,
}
```

### `POST to '/budgets'`

* Used to save a new budget to the database.
* Only worry about creating `ONE` budget for now.

* **NOTE** We only want to `create` a budget, no need to write a getter or even
  update the budget total directly. When we call for data to see how much is
  left in our budget, we'll write a separate endpoint that aggregates that
  information for us. We want to keep our budget total `'pure'` and unaffected
  by our queries.
