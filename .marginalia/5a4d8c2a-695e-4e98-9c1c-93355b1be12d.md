### **Category**

* A category collection will consist of different places you can assign your
  expenses to.
* A category can be something as simple as `groceries`.
* Your relationship to consider here is the relationship between `Expenses` and
  `Categories`
* An example of a category object after it is saved to the databse:

```
{
  _id: ObjectId('543d2c72gsb23cd657438921'),
  title: 'Groceries',
}
```

### `POST to '/categories'`

* to `create` a category you should have a `'post'` method that stores the
  category information.
* you can write a `getter` `'get'` method that simply returns all the
  categories. Filter out any unuseful information here, meaning we just want
  the title of the categories.
* create a minimum of 4 categories so that when you create your expenses, you
  can assign where they go!
* example of categories could be: `Food/Dining` `Gas/Auto` `Date Nights`
  `Mortgage`
