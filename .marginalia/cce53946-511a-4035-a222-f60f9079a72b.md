### **Expense**
* An expense is a purchase one would make that will affect one's budget.
* There will be two relationships tied to an expense, the `budget` it effects, &
  `category` it belongs to.
* An expense object when saved to the database would look something like this:

```
{
  _id: ObjectId('503c2b66bcf86cs793443564'),
  amount: 35,
  description: 'potatoes',
  budget: ObjectId('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011'), // Monthly Spending
  category: ObjectId('543d2c72gsb23cd657438921') // Groceries
}
```

### `'/expenses'`

* your expense should have a `'post'` method for creating the expense. To save
  an expense you'll need an `'budget'` `_id` and a `'category'` `_id` so that we
  can build out a relationship between those other collections and our expenses.
* your expense route should also have a `'get'` method that returns all the
  expenses with the populated data.
