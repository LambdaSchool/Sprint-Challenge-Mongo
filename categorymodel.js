/* `POST to '/category'`

* to `create` a category you should have a `'post'` method that stores the
  category information.
* you can write a `getter` `'get'` method that simply returns all the
  categories. Filter out any unuseful information here, meaning we just want
  the title of the categories.
* create a minimum of 4 categories so that when you create your expenses, you
  can assign where they go!
* example of categories could be: `Food/Dining` `Gas/Auto` `Date Nights`
  `Mortgage`
