1.  The three work in tandem with each other- a document can be viewed as a unit of storage on any particular system, and a collection stores an arbitrary amount of these documents and finally, a database can store any number of collections.  In order to access a document, we must first gain access to the database and its collections. This can be very useful in establishing relational data on a mongoose database and can be accomplished through object models, which provide a way to easily do this. The MVC or Model-view-controller is an architectural pattern for user interfaces.  This shapes the way information is represented and in essence separates it based on the way it is presented to, and accepted from the viewer.  This type of structure has been implemented in Node/Express/Mongoose, simply due to the fact that there is a server side and client side of things.  The client submits a POST or GET request and the server ultimately decides whether or not the request is valid and responds appropriately.
