MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It's a software design pattern for developing web applications. The model is responsible for maintaing the data, the view displays the portion of data we wish to the user, and the controller controls the interactions between the model and the view. 

In the case of mongoose, express, and node, mongoose is the model and is in charge of handling the data for us. The view would actually be handled by React so that's not part of this pattern. Express is a framework that is ran on top of node, and express is more of the controller that we use to access the data via mongoose then send it to react.
