1.  In MongoDB, documents are stored in a collection, which in turn make up a database.
 A DataBase is a set of data  that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
 A Collection is a grouping of documents, that exists within a single database.
 A Document is a unit of storing data- MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. 

 
2.  References store the relationships between data by including links or references from one document to another. 

3. Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern, that divides an application into three interconnected parts.
Model is a place to define data structures and methods to interact with your data store- Mongoose
View is a place to manage everything the end user sees on his or her screen- Express
Controller is a place to take user requests, bring data from the model and pass it back to the view.-Node
