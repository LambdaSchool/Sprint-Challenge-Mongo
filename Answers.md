 DATABASE: A database is a container holding various files/objects linked to each other. Examples of databases are MongoDB, MySQL and MariaDB. 

COLLECTION:
A collection refers to a group that is all in one location. These are usually used to sort a database by type of file and help organize data.

  DOCUMENT:
A document refers to a single file, which is then stored in a collection which itself is stored in a database. So the relationship is DOC < COLLECTION < DATABASE. 

2. 
You can acheive a pattern of relationships in MongoDB by referencing different Schemas in the respective Schema Model as an ObjectID. We fill in the appropriate relational data using mongoose by using these dynamic Schemas.

3.
It is possible to deconstruct an API by assigning different parts of the API to unique routes with the help of Express.
