DataBase is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.

A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents.

A document is a data record such as an ogject.

You can acheive a pattern of relationships in MongoDB by having Model one to one relationships with embedded documents, by having 
Model one to many relationships with embedded documents, and by having Model one to many relationships with document references.

You can break up an API into MVC paradigm. The Model is the data base, the Veiw is the Schema file, and the Controller is the Router file.
