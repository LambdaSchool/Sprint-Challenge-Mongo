1.  Describe the following: `DataBase`, `Collection` , `Document`
    -A `DataBase` is where data is held.  It is structured and can be retrieved.  MongoDB uses a noSQL database.
    -A `Collection` is held within a database and can be considered a child of the database.
    -A `Document` is held within the collection and can be considered the grandchild of the database.
    All of these can be accessed through a database.

1.  Describe how one can achieve the pattern of _relationships_ in MongoDB. What

    appropriate relational data using mongoose?
    -I remember we have to link a schema to collections that we've imported.
1.  Explain a way to break up an API into Sub-Applications, which tool did we use to do that?
