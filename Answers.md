1. Databases stores data and are organized using SQL. MongoDB is different than relational databases, using collections and documents as the model. A collection is like a table and holds the documents. The documents are basically the stored data, and are written in JSON to set key:value pair relationships.

2. MongoDB employs schemas that can be built as a one-on-one relationship with sub-documents, or a one-to-many using references to link among different collections.

3. We used router this week, which is a part of Mongoose that can be used to send routes to the controller functions.
