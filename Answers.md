1.  A database stores data organized in a certain way using SQL. MongoDB is different than relational databases though, and uses collections and documents. A collection is akin to a table and holds the documents. The documents could be defined as the stored data, which use JSON to set key:value pair relationships.

2.  MongoDB uses a schemas which can be built as a one-on-one relationship with sub-documents, or a one-to-many uses references to link among different collections.

3.  We used router, a part of mongoose that can be used to send routes to the appropriate controller functions.
