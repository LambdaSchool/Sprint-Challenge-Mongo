# Sprint Challenge -- MongoDB

 ### Challenge Questions:  

    a. Database: a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
    
    b. Collection: a group of objects or an amount of material accumulated in one location, especially for some purpose or as a result of some process

    c. Document: any type of saved filed usually containing instruction on how a program should process information from a database.

    2. A pattern of relationships can be established in MongoDB by embedding documents withing each other. By storing references within these documents, patterns can be established to make functional use of information stored within a database. MongoDB uses dynamic schema to 'fill' in the appropriate relational data by using mongoose.

    3. An API can be broken down into sub-applications through a database management tool like MongoDB.
