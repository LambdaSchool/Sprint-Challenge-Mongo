  Collection - A list of items within a particular category
  Document - An object containing all related information to
  a particular thing such as a persons account information

2. We create a reference to the related item in the schema, giving it a type of ObjectId and setting it's ref property to the associated model.

3. We primarily used express router to break apart our different end points and manage them. We also set up different documents in our MongoDB database to organize the API data.
